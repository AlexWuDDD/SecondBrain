## Design of Information Devices and System

Sense ==> Process ==> Actuate

- Best when hardware and software work together
  - Best algorithms and best code written by understanding the sensing and compute mechanisms
  - Best devices designed understanding the physical limitations

## System of linear Equations

$$
f(\alpha x_1,\alpha x_2, ......, \alpha x_n) = \alpha f(x_1, x_2, ......, x_n)
$$

$$
f(x_1+y_1, x_2 + y_2, ......, x_n+y_n) = f(x_1, x_2, ......, x_n) + f(y_1, y_2, ......, y_n )
$$
