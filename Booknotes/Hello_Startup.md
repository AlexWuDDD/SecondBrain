## Startup

```txt
A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.(Eric Ries, The Lean Startup)
```

```txt
A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of “exit.” The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.
```

``` txt
A startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model. Within this definition, a startup can be a new venture or it can be a new division or business unit in an existing company.
```

A "tech startup" is an organization with the following characteristics:

1. Product: technology
2. Environment: extermely uncertain
3. Goal: massive growth
4. Mode of operation: search

Autonomy, mastery, and purpose are three of the most powerful human motivatiors.

Only start a company if you're willing to spend the next decade of your life working on it.

All new ideas are just the result of combining existing ideas.
>A better metaphor is to think of new idea as turing on a light bulb to illumunate something that was already there.

Creativity boils down to three stages:

1. Copy
2. Transform
3. Combine
