Jogging

Everyday, in all kinds of weather, thousands of men and women go jogging.
Why has jogging - run slowly for long distance - become so popular?
Most joggers like it because they have heard that it is very good exercise.
Jogging makes heart stronger and helps them lost weight.
It can also help them feel better about themselves.

How fast should you go?
Jog with a friend and talk to each other as you run.
If you have difficulty talking, you are going to fast.
How far should you jog?
Remember not to go too far too soon.
In fact, you should walk, not run, the first few times.
Then do some short jog, but no more than what you can do comfortably.

After that, increase your distance a quarter or half of a mile every two weeks or so.
Maybe, in a few years, you, too, can run in a marathon like thousands of other people do.
