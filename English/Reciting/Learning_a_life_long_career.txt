Learning: a life long career
As food is to the body, so is learning to the mind.
Our bodies grow and muscles develop with the intake of food.
Likewise, we should keep learning day by day to maintain our mental power and expand our intellectual capacity.

Constant learning supplies us fuel for driving us to sharpen our power of reasoning, analysis and judgment.
Contiues learning is the best way to keep pace with times in the information age.

It is a common misunderstanding to regard school as the only place for the acquisition of knowledge.
On the contrary, learning should be an endless process from cradle to grove.
With the world changing so fast, to stop learning just for a few days will make a person lag behand.

Lack of learning will inevitably lead to the stagnation of the mind, or even worse, its fossilization.
Therefore, to stay mentally young, we have to take learning as a life long career.
