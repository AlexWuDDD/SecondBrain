Success
Success means different things for different people.
Some may equit it with fame, some with weath, and still some with accomplishments.
For me, it means that fulfilling one's dream.
Whatever your dreams are, you have a goal there and then focus on all your attention on it.

Dreams bring you hope and happiness.
In the process of struggling for it, you cry, sweat, complain, and even curse, but the joy of harversting will make you 
forget all the pains and troubles you have gone through. 
So an old proverb says that the sweatest fruit is one that has undergone the bitterest ordeal.

There are several keys to success. 
First, your goal must be pritical and priticable.
If you set your goal too high, chances are that you will nerver attain it. 
Next, you need to make a plan of doing it.
You can take several steps to realize it.
Since the process is quite tough, you need to be diligient, patient and persevering.

Even if you meet with diffculties or frustrations, just take them in your stride.
You can always tell yourself that there is nothing insurmountable.
With this will and determination, success is sure to wait for you at the end of the tunnel!
