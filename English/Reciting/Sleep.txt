Sleep

Scientists suggest that today, most adults get up to two hours'less sleep than they need.
As a result, those lacking in sleep are forgetful, tired, less productive and grumpy.
Sleep is the time when our bodies and minds are restored and rested.

There are two kinds of sleep: Rapid Eye Movement and Non-REM.
We need both types to be healthy.

Rapid Eye Movement sleep is when we dream.
Our brains are active and our eyes have fast short movement as if watching something.
This kind of sleep helps restore our mind.
Non-REM sleep is when our brains and bodies slow down.
Our heart rate slows and our breathing is regular.
This kind of sleep restore our body.

We have twice as much Non-REM sleep as Rapid Eye Movement sleep each night.
To get better sleep, have a regualr time for sleep and a routine before you go to bed.
This will give your body signal that it is time to sleep.
Make sure that your bed and bedroom are quite and comfortable.
If your bed is too hard or too soft, or if you are too hot or too cold, you will not sleep well.
For two hours before going to bed, do not drink coffee or alcohol, or do not smoke or exercise.
All these activitives will stimulate your body and make sleep difficult.
