Body Language

Americans feel that physical contacts can be important in breaking down barriers between people.
Such physcial contacts as hugging, shaking hands and kissing in public are seen as display of affction.

In China, on the other hand, this is not common because physical contact is not the custom.
Interesting enough, most Chinese who spent time in American come to like hugging; they learned that Americans use body language to express feelings.
It is a way of saying "I like you and I care about you".

Shaking hands is a traditional way of greeting someone in America.
Shaking hands is a more formal way of greeting than hugging.
Whereas hugging shows closeness, shaking hands means there is a little formality in the relationship.

Western people usually shake hands when meeting some in the first time, or when they see someone again after a certain amount of time has passed.
In Japan, people traditionally bow as a form of greeting.
Other countries have different customs, like patting someone on the back or kissing.
